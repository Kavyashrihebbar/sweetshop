⚙️ How I Used AI

Planned the project structure for backend and frontend.

Generated sample code for Spring Boot controllers, services, and repositories.

Helped write JUnit test cases.

Helped fix API issues between React and Spring Boot.

Assisted in writing this README and organizing project files.
Reflection on AI’s Impact

Using AI made development smoother and faster. It helped me:

Understand backend–frontend integration better.

Learn how to structure code using best practices.

Save time on repetitive tasks like boilerplate generation.

Focus more on logic and testing rather than setup.

I carefully reviewed, edited, and tested all AI-generated code to ensure it meets my learning goals and maintains correctness.
